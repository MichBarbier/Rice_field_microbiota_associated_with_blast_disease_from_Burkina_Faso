Here are the scripts used to analyse the microbiota data in **Sanga et al., 202X : "The root microbiome of rice plants from Burkina Faso harbours the tools to resist against *Pyricularia oryzae*, *Bipolaris oryzae* and *Curvularia lunata*."** 

**To resume :**
Bacterial strains belonging to the genera *Bacillus*, *Burkholderia* and *Priestia* were isolated from rice roots growing in rice fields in Burkina Faso (BF). These strains were found to control the fungal pathogen *Pyricularia oryzae*, a major rice pathogen in BF, during *in vitro
and greenhouse assays. To explore the relevance of these bacteria in the field, rice root microbiota data from **Barro et al., 20XX** (DOI) were analysed. The results showed that *Bacillus* and *Priestia* strains were significantly enriched in rice roots in healthy paddy fields where disease was not reported.

The “Diversity_analysis” script allows to reproduce the **Supplementary Figure XX**, and the “Enrichment_analysis” script allows to reproduce the **Figure 5**. The ASV table and metadata used for the analysis were obtained from **Barro et al., 20XX**.
